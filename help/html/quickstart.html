<h1>Timekeeper in Thirty Seconds</h1>

<p>
If you don't have a lot of time to mess around, you're in luck because Timekeeper lets you hit the ground running very quickly. If you've already installed and launched the program, you're good to go. Let's give it a run.
</p>

<h2> Next Steps </h2>
<ul>
<li> First, make sure you see Timekeeper running with no file loaded:<br/><br/>
     <img src="images/window1.gif" /><br/><br/></li>
<li> Select the <span class="menu">File|New</span> menu command (or press Ctrl+N). </li>
<li> Navigate to a folder where you'd like to store your Timekeeper file. </li>
<li> Type a file name and close the dialog box.<br/><br/>The application should now look like so:
     <br/><br/><img src="images/window2.gif" /><br/><br/> </li>
<li> Now select the <span class="menu">Tasks|Start Timer</span> menu command (or press Ctrl+T). </li>
<li> Go do something for a while. The timer will look like this while running:
     <br/><br/><img src="images/window3.gif" /><br/><br/> </li>
<li> Press Ctrl+T again to stop the timer. </li>
<li> You're done! </li>
</ul>

<h2> Now What? </h2>

<p>
At its most fundamental level, you've now done everything Timekeeper was made to do: keeping track of the time you spend on tasks. Of course, creating data without ever looking at it is rather pointless. Timekeeper lets you examine your time-tracking data in a number of ways.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="reports/grid.html">Time Grid</a> </li>
<li> <a href="reports/list.html">Log Listing</a> </li>
<li> <a href="reports/card.html">Punch Card</a> </li>
</ul>

<h2> Is That All I Can Do? </h2>

<p>
As you've probably already guessed, nope! It would be a pretty poor time-tracking application that only let you record a single task. But that's one of the nice things about Timekeeper: it's complexity grows with you. If you don't need advanced features, they're not in your face. When you're ready for them, just turn 'em on.
