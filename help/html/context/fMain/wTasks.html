<h1>Task List</h1>

<p>
Timekeeper allows you to define one or more tasks for time tracking. The tasks you track are entirely up to you. At it's most basic level, you could create just one task, call it "Working" and log all your time against it.
</p>

<p>
However, it's a bit more interesting to keep track of specific tasks, much in the same way you would keep track of the money you spend. You might define tasks called, "Meetings", "Development", "Support", "Errands", "Personal Time", and so on. What you define depends heavily on your role.
</p>

<p>
If you work on the same tasks repeatedly but across different projects, Timekeeper allows you to create a second dimension through <a href="wProjects.html">project tracking</a>.
</p>

<h2>Creating Tasks</h2>

<p><img src="../../images/new-task.gif" align="right" />Creating new tasks is easy. Use the <span class="menu">Tasks | New Task</span> menu function or right-click anywhere on the Task pane and select <span class="menu">New Task</span>.</p>

<p> Give the task a name and an optional description. You can associate it with a folder (if any folders have been defined) or leave it at the top level. Click Save and you're done. You can now log time against this new task. </p>

<h2>Other Task Functions</h2>

<ol>
<li> <b>Edit Task</b>. Edit the name, description, or folder parent. </li>
<li> <b>Rename Task</b>. Quick task name edit, directly in the Task pane. </li>
<li> <b>Hide Task</b>. Remove a task from the Task pane. You can still report on time logged under hidden tasks. </li>
<li> <b>Delete Task</b>. Remove a task from the application completely.</li>
<li> <b>Task Properties</b>. Display information about a task including the date it was created and the amount of time logged against it.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Grouping Tasks</h2>

<p>Timekeeper supports Task folders for grouping related tasks. For example, let's say you're a video editor and you want to have tasks for pre-production, production, and post-production. Create one task folder for each, then add individual tasks, like so:</p>

<p>
<img src="../../images/task-folders.gif" />
</p>

<p>
You can move tasks to a different folder by right-clicking a task, selecting Edit, and then changing its parent. You may also drag tasks to a new folder.
