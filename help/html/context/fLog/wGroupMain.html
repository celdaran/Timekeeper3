<h1>Log Browser Interface</h1>

<p>The Log Browser allows you to view, edit, and search Timekeeper entries.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Moving from row to row (using either the navigation buttons or the <a href="wResults.html">search results display</a> automatically saves your changes. If you make an unwanted change, you must either hit Ctrl+Z to undo or press the system close button ("x") in the upper right.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Use YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss date/time formats everywhere in Timekeeper.</p>

<h2>Start Time</h2>

<p>This control shows the start time of the entry. It can be edited.</p>

<h2>Close Start Time Gap</h2>

<p>Use the <span class="menu">&lt;—</span> button to set the start time value equal to the value of the previous row's end time. This closes any time gaps between the two Timekeeper entries, for example, if you were continuously working and forgot to start the timer again.</p>

<h2>End Time</h2>

<p>This control shows the end time of the entry. It can be edited. Changing the end time automatically updates the duration of the entry.</p>

<h2>Close End Time Gap</h2>

<p>Use the <span class="menu">—&gt;</span> button to set the end time value equal to the value of the next row's start time. This closes any time gaps between the two Timekeeper entries. If this is the last entry in the file, this sets the end time equal to the current date and time.</p>

<h2>Duration</h2>

<p>This control shows the duration of the entry in hours, minutes, and seconds (hh:mm:ss). You can edit the duration directly. Doing so automatically updates the end time of the entry.</p>

<h2>Pre Log</h2>

<p>This displays the annotation (if any) entered when the timer began.</p>

<h2>Post Log</h2>

<p>This displays the annotation (if any) entered after the timer ended.</p>
