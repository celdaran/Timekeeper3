<ul>

<li> 1190: Added "hours" as a supported time format on Grid control. </li>
<li> 1195: Re-wrote grid population from scratch (vast performance improvement, also now sorts alphabetically by default). </li>
<li> 1198: The first/last/prev/next buttons use the log entry's timestamp for chronology, not its row identifier. </li>

<li> 1215: File menu is now disabled while timer is running. </li>
<li> 1232: Implemented journal entry count to About box. </li>
<li> 1233: Fixed Report ordering. </li>

<li> Minor bug fixes (See below 1162, 1167, and 1173). </li>
<li> Internals: Many functions (primarily database access) now use <a href="http://www.technitivity.com/toolbox/">Technitivity Toolbox</a>. </li>
<li> Internals: Target Platform changed from .NET 2.0 to .NET 4.0. <b>Note</b>: Windows 2000 is no longer supported. </li>
