  * Added a "remove" button to deassign a keyboard mapping.

April 24, 2011:
  * One more pass through the todo list, added a Priority column
  * Worked on help file.

April 25, 2011:
  * Fixed issue with malformed meta table. db.check is improved yet again.

  * Tasks menu isn't quite right when Projects are hidden (1133)
  * Add "Start/Stop Timer" to context/popup menu (1141)

April 27, 2011:

  * 1133 Tasks menu isn't quite right when Projects are hidden

April 28, 2011:
  * Topped off the installer

April 30, 2011:

  * 1096 Automatically reload most recent saved grid view on the grid dialog
  * 1115 Replace "no timer is running" ShowMessage with real dialog w/ inline options
  * 1134 Maybe disable the "close gap" button if the gap is already closed.
  * 1135 Add some "how to unhide" instructions to the Hide confirmation.
  * 1136 Add a "don't show this again" checkbox to the Hide confirmation dialog.
  * 1138 After a virgin install on Jason's box, he got the "index out of range" error.
  * 1143 Using the close gap buttons does not set the dirty bit
  * 1144 Save the "Log Report" window metrics.
  * 1145 Allow a TKDB file to be passed on the command line.
  * 1146 Accidentally selecting a very large amount of data on the Report Grid is bad.
  * 1147 Prevent reordering of tasks while the timer is running.
  * 1148 Remove "Timer" tab from Options dialog: everything there can go to "Behavior"
  * 1149 Log browser: add an explicit cancel button
  * 1150 Log browser: don't reset box each time into it

May 1, 2011:

  * 1037 Icon still needs work. It's all new, fresh, and wonderful now. *sheesh*

May 2, 2011:

  Went past my deadline. Those last two bugs were annoying me so much:
  
  * 1156 Null object reference error on first launch.
  * 1157 Right-clicking a task and selecting properties dies if no task actually selected.
  * 1158 The about box colors look wrong on Aero.

-------------------------
Timekeeper 2.3 Change Log
-------------------------

Before October 7, 2012:

  * Removed cruft from unused TK3 interface experiments.

  * The About box was dated 9/1/2011 and spoke of a Beta 5. I did not find any code
    changes to go along with this, outside of the About box change.

  * Created Technitivity.Toolbox as a base for future Timekeeper work.

October 6, 2012 (Changeset 205):

  * Changed target from Any CPU to x86.
  * Updated to .NET 4.0
  * More internals work.

October 7, 2012 (Changeset 209, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215)

  * Fixed the Timekeeper.Common vs Toolbox.Common split.
  * Converted the app to use the new Technitivity.Toolbox library instead of its own
    internal classes, such as DBI, UUID, Common, and so on.
  * TKT #1162: fixed the "longer than 64 characters" bug.
  * TKT #1167: fixed the problem with fLog dropdowns growing out of control.
  * TKT #1173: fixed the "Edit.." display bug.
  * TKT #1179: fixed modality of report and grid windows.
  * TKT #1215: disabled entire File menu while timer is running.

October 8, 2012 (Changeset 216, 217, 218)

  * TKT #1195: re-wrote grid population from scratch
  * TKT #1198: first/last/prev/next buttons use timestamp_s for chronology, not tkid
  * TKT #1221: fixed boolean problem (residual issue from Toolbox.DBI)
  * TKT #1224: fixed display problem (changed Tuple to Pair)
  * Largely a bug fix pass: bad "" vs. null checks, boolean issues, plus a
    fairly large problem with the new _load_grid2() method

October 9, 2012 (Changeset 219)

  * TKT #1177: Enhanced date presets on Grid control (Yesterday, Previous Day, Last
    Month, Last Year, and a revised This Week).

October 10, 2012 (Changeset 221, 222)

  * A few more minor bug fixes and tweaks. This is officially 2.3 beta 2.
  * TKT #1190: Add "hours" to time format on grid control.
  * TKT #1226: Datatype error on grid.
  * TKT #1227: Null/bool issue in fLog.
  * TKT #1229: Total total missing from Grid.
  * TKT #1232: Implemented journal entry count to About box.

  * TKT #1238: "This Week" calculation not right.
  * TKT #1237: Fixed broken search.
  * TKT #1235: Close all open windows when DB is closed.
  * TKT #1233: Report now orders by date.
  * TKT #1240: Calendar exploding when selecting tasks/projects.
  * TKT #1159: Changed how notification works: now uses NotifyIcon ShowBubble.
  * TKT #1116: Implicitly fixed by fixing 1159.

October 11, 2012 (Changeset 223, 224)

  * Decided to just stamp this 2.3 Beta 3.
  * Updated the version number and this file.
  * Updated the About box (somehow forgot that)

October 12, 2012 (Changesets 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234)

  * Added timekeeper/setup to p4.
  * Added timekeeper/help to p4.
  * Updated the installation script (timekeeper.iss).
  * Renamed timekeeper/help/html/whatsnew.html.
  * Minimal updates to the help system (still incomplete).
