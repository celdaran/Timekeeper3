will be registered and a Start Menu folder will be created. You can easily uninstall
it from the Windows Control Panel. (It's only three files.) If you prefer to be less
integrated, download the "Without Installer" option and place the files in a folder
of your choice.

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>If you have the software already installed, press F1 (or click the "?" button on most dialog boxes) for context-senstive help in the form of a compiled HTML (chm) file.</p>
<p>Or just <a href="help/index.html">view help online</a>.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p>
While this software is the hobby of a single developer, it has been so since 1999
with no signs of slowing down. Time tracking is a bit of a compulsion of mine, so
I plan to keep at this for as long as I still have this brain. I cannot provide
individual support but I can promise that I'll keep developing this software for
well into the foreseeable future.
